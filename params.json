{"name":"Thesis","tagline":"Graduation Thesis Planning for My Master Degree - Leyi Song 2014","body":"### Welcome to My Thesis Pages.\r\nThis page is the start page of my thesis project. In this blog, I will kick off my project, plan the thesis structure and works, track the progress, and deliver thesis promptly. \r\n\r\n### My Goal\r\nMain idea of my graduation thesis is that: Location-based service based on massive trajectories and geo-spatial semantic knowledge. I will focus on the following topics:\r\n```\r\nLarge-scale Trajectory Analysis\r\nKnowledge Base and Knowledge Data Management\r\nMulti-source Data Fusion\r\nLocation Recommendation \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Previous Works \r\n \r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Ongoing Works\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Cherry Wang (@chywang), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Detailed Plan\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
